src/main/resources/sql-data.sql and src/test/resources/sql-data.sql: changed the test and runner populating data so that they would populate the correct database for testing purposes and so that I could check CRUD functionality without having to create each time.

src/main/resources/sql-schema and src/test/resources/sql-schema: changed both so that it would recreate the database and reset all auto-incrementing stages for testing purposes. Will remove from main once testing has concluded as it removes all logged data from the database each time the app runs.
